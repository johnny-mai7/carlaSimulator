# carlaSimulator

Conducted a literature review on simulation environments.
Explored and modified the CARLA simulator for real driver use.
Tested CARLA's capabilities in:
Simulating realistic weather conditions (rain, snow, fog).
Incorporating pedestrian activity.
Designing unique road systems (e.g., diverging diamond interchange).
Generating diverse driving scenarios to evaluate driver behavior.
Integrating driving peripherals (e.g., steering wheel) for enhanced immersion.
Ensuring compatibility with VR systems.
Integrating with SUMO traffic simulator for potential synergies.
